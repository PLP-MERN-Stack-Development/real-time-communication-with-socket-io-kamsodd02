## Quick Start (for beginners)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+ (https://nodejs.org)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Run locally (step-by-step)
1. Unzip this folder.
2. Start the server:
   ```
   cd realtime-chat-app-final/server
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   Server defaults to http://localhost:5000
3. Start the client in a second terminal:
   ```
   cd realtime-chat-app-final/client
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   Client defaults to http://localhost:5173
4. Open the client URL, enter a username, and start chatting. Open multiple tabs to test realtime features.

## Deploying Live (short)
- Deploy the server to Render (or Heroku). Point VITE_SOCKET_URL on the client to the server URL.
- Deploy the client to Vercel (or Netlify). Set the environment variable VITE_SOCKET_URL to your server URL.

## Notes & Next Steps
- This project stores data in memory (for demo). For production, replace with a database (MongoDB/Postgres) and use Redis adapter for socket scaling.
- Add HTTPS and secure cookies for production.
- Replace the notify.mp3 placeholder with a real sound file.
